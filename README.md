This repository contains a compilation of python code from a group project in which we analyzed the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data to discover predictors for different health outcomes.

We utilized many different common data science techniques including, but not limited to, principal component analysis (PCA), linear/logistic regression, KNN regression/classification, and
different visualization methods as well.
